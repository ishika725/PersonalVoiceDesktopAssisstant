The goal of the project is to investigate the potential of AIML for developing models for detecting gender and age. AIML is used to create complex patterns and templates that capture the particular characteristics that distinguish various genders and age groups. Its structure is similar to rule-based programming. These AIML components form the basis for classifiers designed to infer gender and age from various input streams, including photos and videos. In addition, the study examines how well AIML models may be translated to various contextual contexts across domains and languages. The resulting insights provide a comprehensive understanding of AIML's abilities as a flexible tool for gender and age prediction, possibly overcoming linguistic constraints and intricate domain-specific details.
